# Mylo – April 2025

**Mylo** is a modern document platform that cleanly separates content creation from layout and design. It empowers writers to focus purely on writing while ensuring visual consistency through role-based templates and styles.

## 🚀 Overview

Most writing tools today either:

- Give writers full control over formatting (leading to inconsistencies), or
- Require design expertise to maintain brand alignment.

**Mylo** solves this by introducing two distinct roles:

- **Contributors** (Writers): Draft content freely in a structured editor.
- **Template Editors** (Designers): Define how the final output looks, using layout templates and typographic styles.
- **Admins**: Manage users, templates, and permissions.

## 🧩 Key Features

- 🔄 **Live Editor + Preview Panel** – Write in one panel, see formatted output in another.
- 🧠 **Template Enforcement** – Templates apply consistent layout and styling across all documents.
- 💾 **Local Save & Export** – Save documents as `.mylo` files or export as PDFs.
- 🎨 **Design System Support** – Control type, spacing, layout, and imagery at the template level.
- 🔐 **Role-Based Access** – Writers, Designers, Admins, and Guests all have specific capabilities.
