# Template Editor User Stories — v1.1

June 2025

## Overview

These user stories define the behavior and expectations for the Template Editor role in Mylo. Template Editors create, style, and publish templates that control the Preview and exported appearance of Contributor content.

Template Editors inherit all Contributor capabilities.

## MVP User Stories

- As a Template Editor, I want to create and save templates, so I can define document appearance.
- As a Template Editor, I want to define layout settings (margins, page size), so the output matches my design needs.
- As a Template Editor, I want to create reusable text styles (e.g., Headline, Body), so Contributors write without worrying about formatting.
- As a Template Editor, I want to apply global Template Settings (e.g., hyphenation, spacing rules), so I ensure brand consistency.
- As a Template Editor, I want to test templates using **sample content**, so I can verify layout without needing real content.
- As a Template Editor, I want to **keep sample content hidden from Contributors**, so they see a clean Preview.
- As a Template Editor, I want to upload fonts or logos, so I can apply brand assets.
- As a Template Editor, I want to export a document with applied styles, so I can validate final output.

## Post-MVP User Stories

- As a Template Editor, I want to preview my template with real Contributor content, so I can see how my design performs in context.
- As a Template Editor, I want to save multiple versions of a template, so I can iterate safely.
- As a Template Editor, I want to restore a previous version of a template, so I can undo unintended changes.
- As a Template Editor, I want to tag or label templates by use case (e.g., report, newsletter), so Contributors find them easily.
