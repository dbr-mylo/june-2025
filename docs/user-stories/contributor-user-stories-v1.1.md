# Contributor User Stories — v1.1

June 2025

---

## Overview

These user stories define the capabilities and boundaries of the Contributor role in Mylo. Contributors focus solely on writing. They do not control the layout, styles, or formatting in the Preview panel.

## MVP User Stories

- As a Contributor, I want to write freely using formatting tools in the Editor, so I can focus on content.
- As a Contributor, I want to see a live Preview of my writing using the assigned Template, so I understand how it will look.
- As a Contributor, I want to **know that my manual formatting in the Editor does not affect the Preview**, so I can focus on structure over style.
- As a Contributor, I want to switch templates mid-document, so I can experiment with different layouts.
- As a Contributor, I want to receive a **warning before switching templates** if it will change the Preview appearance.
- As a Contributor, I want to autosave my changes while writing, so I don’t lose work.
- As a Contributor, I want to manually trigger a version save with Cmd+S, so I can capture milestones.
- As a Contributor, I want to export my document as a PDF, so I can share the final version.
- As a Contributor, I want to download and reopen my document as a `.mylo` file, so I can work offline.

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- As a Contributor, I want to receive AI suggestions for editing or rewriting content.
- As a Contributor, I want to toggle the Preview on/off for distraction-free writing.
- As a Contributor, I want to see which elements in the Preview were inferred (e.g., headings or lists).
