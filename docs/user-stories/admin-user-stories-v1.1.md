# Admin User Stories — v1.1

June 2025

---

## Overview

These user stories define the core responsibilities and capabilities of the Admin role in Mylo. Admins inherit all Contributor and Template Editor permissions and gain elevated access to user management, trash, and version history.

## MVP User Stories

- As an Admin, I want to create and manage users, so I can control who has access to Mylo.
- As an Admin, I want to assign roles (Contributor, Template Editor, Admin), so each user sees the correct interface.
- As an Admin, I want to assign templates to teams or groups, so Contributors only see the appropriate branded templates.
- As an Admin, I want to access a list of all documents and templates, so I can monitor usage.
- As an Admin, I want to delete or archive users, so I can manage team membership cleanly.
- As an Admin, I want to access the Trash and restore deleted documents or templates, so important work is not lost.
- As an Admin, I want to view version history for documents or templates, so I can understand changes over time.
- As an Admin, I want to manage Template Sets and assign them to teams, so template governance is scalable.
- As an Admin, I want to download team documents or templates for backup or audit.

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- As an Admin, I want to view an audit log of user and template activity.
- As an Admin, I want to impersonate or simulate another role, so I can troubleshoot user issues.
- As an Admin, I want to bulk reassign templates or documents.
- As an Admin, I want to receive alerts if a template or document fails to load.
