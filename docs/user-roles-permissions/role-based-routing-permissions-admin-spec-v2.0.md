# Mylo Role-Based Routing & Permissions (Admin Role) Specification

This specification defines role-based access and routing logic for the **Admin** role, ensuring Admins have access to all pages and features, including both content and design-related features.

---

# Overview

Admins should have access to all pages and features within Mylo, including both **writing-related** and **design-related pages**, as well as **admin functionalities** such as user management and settings.

---

# MVP Scope

- **React Router** will be used to handle **role-based page access**.
- Admins will have access to all pages, including `/write`, `/documents`, `/templates`, `/template-creation`, and **admin-specific pages** (e.g., `/admin/users`, `/admin/settings`).
- Unauthorized attempts to access pages will be handled by the **Admin**, who has full permissions.

---

# Functional Requirements

**Admin**
- As an Admin, I have access to **all pages** within Mylo, including writing, design, and **admin functionalities** (e.g., `/admin/users`, `/admin/settings`).
- Admins will be able to **view, edit, and delete** content, templates, and user permissions as outlined in **[Admin User Stories](file-admin-user-stories.md)**.

**Developer**
- As a Developer, I will implement routing logic using **React Router** to ensure Admins have full access to all pages.
- As a Developer, I will ensure that role-specific pages are **conditionally rendered** and **redirect unauthorized users** as needed.
- Admin permissions will be explicitly checked to ensure they can **access all areas** of the app.

# Error Handling

| Failure                        | System Response | User-facing Message |
|:---                            |:---             |:---                 |
| Admin tries to access restricted page | Allow access (no restriction for Admin) | "You have full access to this page." |

---

# Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Fine-grained permission controls for admins to manage **specific user roles** and **restricted content**.
- Enhanced admin dashboard features, including **real-time user tracking** and **role modification**.
