# Mylo Starter Kit — Specification Organization Standard (v2.1)

All official Mylo Starter Kit specifications must follow the structure defined below. This ensures consistency, clarity, and efficient onboarding for anyone contributing to Mylo documentation or feature development.

---

## 📘 Overview

Each specification must begin with a clear overview that explains the purpose and scope of the document at a high level.

---

## 🧩 MVP Scope

This section defines what functionality, features, or behaviors are included for the initial MVP release of the feature. Items outside the MVP must be excluded or listed separately in Future Enhancements.

---

## 🔍 [Main Behavior Sections]

One or more detailed sections describing how the system behaves, including:

- Save Behavior Rules
- UI Behavior
- Stack Behavior
- Data Models
- Field Definitions
- etc.

This section may be subdivided with additional second-level headings (`##`) as needed.

---

## 🔧 [Additional Technical Sections] (Optional)

If the feature has diagrams, complex flows, API schemas, or other technical artifacts, they should be included after the main behavior sections. These are optional depending on feature complexity.

---

## ❌ Error Handling

A mandatory section defining how the system responds to failures, backend errors, invalid state, etc.

---

## 🚧 Gaps & Future Enhancements

The final section lists:

- Known missing features
- Open technical or design questions
- Areas to revisit post-MVP

This section ensures the MVP remains focused while tracking future priorities.
