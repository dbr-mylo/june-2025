# Smart Style Inference â€“ Risks & Mitigations

## Overview
Smart heuristics infer style roles (e.g., headings vs. body text) based on formatting behaviors to apply consistent preview styling.

## Key Risks

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Notes |
|---------|------------------|------------|--------|----------|-------|
| R1 | Incorrect classification of content leading to mismatched styles. | High | Medium | High |  |
| R2 | Overwriting user-intended structure due to heuristics. | Medium | Medium | Medium |  |

## Mitigations

| Risk ID | Mitigation Strategy | Owner | Status | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|--------|--------|-------|
| R1 | Log inferred styles and allow users to override manually post-MVP. | AI Team | Planned |  |
| R2 | Use only non-destructive inference for preview; editor content remains unchanged. | Dev Team | Complete |  |
