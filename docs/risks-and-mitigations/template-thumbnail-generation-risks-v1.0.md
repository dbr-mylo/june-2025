# Thumbnail Creation for Templates — Risks & Mitigations

This document outlines potential risks associated with the Thumbnail Creation feature in Mylo and proposes mitigation strategies for each.

---

# Overview

Thumbnail generation introduces automation and visual rendering logic to the Mylo platform. It requires system stability, consistent rendering fidelity, and seamless integration with storage and the UI. The following risks were identified for MVP implementation.

# Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|--------|------------|
| Thumbnail fails to generate | Layout is invalid or rendering engine crashes during capture | Medium | Medium | Show fallback thumbnail; log error; allow user to retry |
| Storage upload fails | Image cannot be stored in Supabase due to network or storage issue | Medium | High | Retry upload; alert user; defer retry in background |
| Debounce not respected | Too many saves trigger repeated thumbnail generation | Low | Medium | Add throttle/debounce logic in frontend logic |
| Outdated thumbnail displayed | UI shows a stale thumbnail that doesn’t match template | Medium | Low | Regenerate on every eligible save; invalidate cache on update |
| Visual regression in thumbnail | Generated image doesn’t represent the intended layout | Low | Medium | Include visual tests for capture snapshot; allow manual regeneration |
| Placeholder shown too often | Placeholder appears even when a thumbnail could be generated | Low | Low | Ensure logic checks layout existence before skipping generation |
| Contributor tries to edit thumbnail | Unauthorized role attempts to update thumbnails | Low | Low | Restrict update functionality to Template Editor and Admin roles only |
