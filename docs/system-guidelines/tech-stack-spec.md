# Mylo Tech Stack Specification

This specification outlines the technologies and services used in the development of Mylo. It includes the frontend, backend, AI integration, file handling, authentication, deployment, and version control.

---

# Overview

Mylo's tech stack is designed to provide a flexible, scalable, and maintainable solution. It leverages modern tools and technologies, including React, Supabase, OpenAI, Mammoth.js, and Vercel, to build a seamless user experience for all roles.

---

# 1. Frontend: **React**
- We’ll use **React** for building the frontend to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. React's **component-based architecture** enables the efficient building of panels, dashboards, and real-time features necessary for Mylo, ensuring flexibility and scalability.
- React's integration with state management libraries like **Redux** will help manage global states like user sessions and document data.

---

# 2. Backend: **Supabase**
- For the backend, we'll use **Supabase**, an open-source platform built on **PostgreSQL**, which provides **real-time data syncing**, user authentication, and file storage. This will handle user authentication, data storage, and real-time features (like collaborative editing).
- Supabase’s **PostgreSQL database** will efficiently manage user data, templates, and documents, offering flexibility with relational data while allowing **scalability**.
- Supabase also supports **OAuth** integrations, making it easy for users to log in using Google, GitHub, etc.

---

# 3. AI Integration (Planned Post-MVP)
> ⚠️ AI features are **not part of the MVP**. This section outlines future potential integrations.
- Future versions of Mylo may integrate **OpenAI** to support writing assistance, such as suggesting content, rewriting, or summarizing.
- We may also explore using tools like **TensorFlow** or **Google AI** to assist with **template creation** or layout suggestions.
- These enhancements would be introduced only after core document workflows and formatting logic are complete.

---

# 4. File Handling: **Mammoth.js**
- **Mammoth.js** will be used to import and export Word files as clean HTML. This allows users to **upload Word documents** directly without complex parsing, converting them into an editable format within Mylo.
- Future expansions could support **additional file formats**, but for now, Mammoth.js offers a simple, efficient, and clean solution for Word file handling.
- **Error handling** will be implemented to catch **corrupted files**, providing user-friendly error messages and ensuring files can be recovered where possible.

---

# 5. Authentication & Security: **Supabase Authentication**
- **Supabase's built-in authentication** system will handle secure logins and user management. It supports **OAuth** for logging in via services like **Google** and **GitHub**.
- All user passwords will be stored in a **hashed and salted** format to ensure security.
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA)** will be implemented to enhance login security.
- Supabase also supports fine-grained **role-based access control (RBAC)** for secure data access and permissions management.

---

# 6. Deployment: **Vercel**
- **Vercel** will handle the deployment of Mylo’s frontend and backend. It integrates seamlessly with **React** and offers **serverless functions**, automatic scaling, and fast deployment speeds, making it ideal for Mylo.
- Deployment will be automated via **CI/CD** pipelines set up with **GitHub Actions** and Vercel’s integration, ensuring fast and seamless deployment with every commit.
- **Vercel’s edge network** will allow Mylo to scale efficiently, reducing latency and ensuring **quick load times** globally.

---

# 7. Version Control: **GitHub**
- **GitHub** will be used for version control to manage the source code, track changes, and facilitate collaboration.
- GitHub's **branching model** and **pull requests** will ensure smooth collaboration and code reviews.
- **GitHub Actions** will automate deployment processes, including tests, builds, and deployment to Vercel.
