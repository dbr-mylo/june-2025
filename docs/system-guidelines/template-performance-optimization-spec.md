# Template Performance Optimization Specification

This document defines caching, lazy loading, and performance optimization behaviors related to Templates in Mylo.

The goal is to ensure fast, seamless document editing and preview experiences even as the number of Templates grows.

---

# Overview

Templates may include typography settings, layout instructions, images (logos), and structural metadata.

To avoid slow load times and unnecessary data transfer:

- Templates must be **cached locally** after initial load.
- **Lazy loading** must be used to defer loading full Template data until needed.
- Templates must be **invalidated and refreshed** cleanly when updated.

Optimizing Template handling is critical to scaling Mylo's performance while maintaining responsiveness.

# MVP Performance Requirements

| Area | Behavior |
|:---|:---|
| Template Caching | Cache Templates locally after first fetch. |
| Cache Scope | Per user session (in-memory cache, not persistent between browser restarts). |
| Template Prefetching | Prefetch Templates assigned to documents visible on the Dashboard. |
| Lazy Loading | Load full Template data only when user actively opens a document or Preview. |
| Cache Invalidation | If a Template is updated (new version published), invalidate cached copy on next session start or manual refresh. |
| Asset Caching | Logo images or external assets referenced in Templates should follow standard browser caching policies (max-age, etags). |

---

# Lazy Loading Behavior

| Trigger | Behavior |
|:---|:---|
| Opening a Document | Load only the assigned Template at full detail. |
| Dashboard File List | Prefetch lightweight metadata (Template name, thumbnail, basic styles) but defer full load until document open. |
| Switching Templates | Load new Template data on demand, caching it afterward. |

Lazy loading ensures that Mylo does not download all Templates upfront, reducing initial load times.

---

# Offline Considerations (MVP)

- If a Template was cached during a prior session and browser session remains active, allow document open even if offline.
- If the Template is missing from cache during offline state, show an error ("Template unavailable — please reconnect").

---

# Cache Invalidation Rules

| Situation | Cache Behavior |
|:---|:---|
| Template updated (new styles published) | Invalidate cached version on next user login or dashboard refresh. |
| User manually refreshes Templates | Force fetch of latest versions from server. |
| Cache too old (session > 12 hours) | Automatically expire and refresh on next access. |

Cache invalidation ensures Contributors always work with up-to-date styles.

---

# Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Persistent local storage of Templates (across sessions) for offline editing.
- Delta-updating Templates (fetch only changes instead of full template reload).
- Smart predictive preloading based on user document history.
- Global template cache for organizations (shared access optimization).
