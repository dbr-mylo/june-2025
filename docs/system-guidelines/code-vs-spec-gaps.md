# Code vs Spec Gaps â€“ June 2025 Audit

This document tracks structural gaps between current code implementation and the specifications defined for the Mylo MVP. These items reflect key features or flows mentioned in specs that have not yet been scaffolded or stubbed in the codebase.

## Next Steps

These gaps should either be:

- Flagged in roadmap for short-term implementation.

All changes should be tracked with commit messages referencing: `code-vs-spec-gap`.
