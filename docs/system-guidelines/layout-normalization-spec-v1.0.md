# Layout Normalization Spec ‚Äî Editor + Preview Panel Alignment

## Purpose

This spec defines a unified layout baseline for Mylo's Editor and Preview panels. The goal is to eliminate unintentional visual drift between the two panels by removing all default padding, margin, and spacing ‚Äî then reintroducing shared layout spacing deliberately. This will serve as the foundation for introducing paper-size-aware layout rules in the future.

## üîß Phase 1: Level-Set Baseline Layout (MVP Priority)

### Requirements

* [ ] Remove all panel-level `padding` and `margin` from Editor and Preview
* [ ] Reset content containers to `padding: 0`, `margin: 0`, `width: 100%`
* [ ] Use a shared `.content-wrapper` class applied to both panels
* [ ] Do **not** rely on default browser spacing (e.g., for `<p>`, `<ul>`)
* [ ] Disable or remove hardcoded spacing in Preview that is not template-driven

### Rationale

* Prevents visual drift between the panels
* Ensures all layout behavior is explicitly defined
* Sets up future support for paper sizing and margin systems

---

## üß± Phase 2: Reintroduce Controlled Padding (Post-Level-Set)

### Requirements

* [ ] Add a shared padding system (e.g., `padding: 48px 64px`) to `.content-wrapper`
* [ ] Apply padding consistently in both panels to create breathing room
* [ ] Use CSS variables or Tailwind utility classes for maintainability
* [ ] Position content relative to this spacing ‚Äî not the panel edges

### Rationale

* Improves visual clarity without introducing inconsistency
* Prepares for page margin controls

## üìê Future: Paper Size + Page Margin Logic

### Placeholder Plan

* Define paper sizes (Letter, A4, Legal) with corresponding `max-width` and `padding`
* Introduce `.document-page` or `<DocumentCanvas>` wrapper
* Support margin presets per paper size (e.g., 96px top, 72px left/right)
* Scrollable multi-page layout can be layered on top

---

## ‚ùå Out of Scope

* Typographic vertical rhythm or text-specific spacing
* Canvas framing or printable page render logic
* Page breaks, headers/footers, or PDF-specific rules
