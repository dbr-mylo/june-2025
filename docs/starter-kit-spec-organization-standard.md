# Mylo Starter Kit — Specification Organization Standard

All official Mylo Starter Kit specifications must follow the structure defined below. This ensures consistency, clarity, and efficient onboarding for anyone contributing to Mylo documentation or feature development.

---

# Overview

Each specification must begin with a clear overview that explains the purpose and scope of the document at a high level.

---

# MVP Scope

This section defines what functionality, features, or behaviors are included for the initial MVP release of the feature. Items outside the MVP must be excluded or listed separately in Future Enhancements.

---

# [Main Behavior Sections]

One or more detailed sections describing how the system behaves, including:

- Save Behavior Rules
- UI Behavior
- Stack Behavior
- Data Models
- Field Definitions
- etc.

This section may be subdivided with additional second-level headings (`##`) as needed.

---

# [Additional Technical Sections] (Optional)

If the feature has diagrams, complex flows, API schemas, or other technical artifacts, they should be included after the main behavior sections. These are optional depending on feature complexity.

---

# Error Handling

A mandatory section defining how the system responds to failures, including:

- Save errors
- Export errors
- Sync issues
- Validation failures

Include system response behavior, fallback plans, and user-visible messages if applicable.

---

# Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

Clearly outline any planned improvements, expansions, or advanced functionality that will not be part of the MVP. Use simple bullet points or short explanations.

---

# Version

Each document must end with a `# Version` heading, followed by the spec name, version number, and date in this format:

Mylo [Feature Name] Specification v1.0 — [Month Year]

Example:

Mylo Font Handling Specification v1.0 — April 2025

---

# Notes

- Major section headings must use a **single `#`** symbol (not `##`).
- Subsections inside main behavior sections can use `##` or `###` as needed.
- Each major section must be separated by a horizontal rule `---` for clarity.
- Documents must maintain formal, technical language throughout.
