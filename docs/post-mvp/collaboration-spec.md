# Mylo Collaboration Specification (Post-MVP)

---

# Overview

This document defines the future vision for real-time collaboration in the Mylo platform. This functionality is **not** part of the MVP scope and is planned for implementation in a post-MVP release cycle.

---

# Status

**Post-MVP** â€” This feature will not be implemented in the initial MVP release.

---

# Purpose

Enable multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously with live updates, cursors, and change indicators. This enhances productivity for teams and supports collaborative workflows in enterprise and agency environments.

---

# Proposed Scope (Post-MVP)

- Real-time multi-user editing
- Live presence indicators (user avatars, cursor names)
- Per-user cursor tracking and selection highlighting
- Conflict resolution system for simultaneous edits
- "Currently Editing" metadata tracking
- Optional live commenting system

---

# MVP Behavior (Confirmed)

- **Single-user editing only**
- Collaboration features are fully disabled
- No user presence indicators
- No live syncing between users
- Document lockout or warning if a second user tries to open an in-use document (implementation TBD)

---

# Dependencies

- Supabase or similar backend with WebSocket support
- Operational Transform (OT) or Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) strategy
- Authenticated session handling and document ownership model

---

# Future Considerations

- Track changes mode
- Reviewer role
- Integrated AI co-editing with attribution
- Comment threads and notifications
- Shared editing permissions model
