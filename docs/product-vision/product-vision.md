# Mylo Product Vision

## Overview

**Mylo** is a modern document platform designed to separate **content creation** from **design enforcement**.

Contributors can focus purely on their ideas, while Templates â€” created by a dedicated role â€” automatically ensure brand consistency without burdening the writing process. Mylo combines the best parts of word processing, design systems, and content workflows into a single, intuitive experience.

---

## Problem Statement

In most tools today, contributors are forced to make design decisions:
- Which font to use?
- How big should the heading be?
- Where should images go?

This slows writing down, causes inconsistencies, and leads to documents that stray from brand guidelines. Design tools (like Adobe InDesign) are too complicated for pure content creators, while simple word processors (like Word and Google Docs) offer little control over visual standards.

Companies are left patching together ad-hoc processes, manual reviews, and late-stage redesigns â€” wasting time, energy, and budget.

## Solution Summary

Mylo cleanly separates concerns:
- **Contributors** work in a clean editor, focused solely on text and ideas.
- **Template Editors**  define how documents *look and feel* through Templates.
- **Templates** automatically apply correct styles, layouts, and formatting during Preview and Export.

The result: beautifully consistent, brand-aligned documents â€” without slowing down the creative process.

---

## Core Philosophy

- **Content First, Layout Last:** Contributors create freely without thinking about fonts, sizes, margins, or colors.
- **Separation of Roles:** Contributors and Template Editors have clear, non-overlapping responsibilities.
- **Structured Flexibility:** Contributors can format freely while writing, but templates enforce appearance at output.
- **Brand Integrity by Design:** Consistency happens automatically, not manually.
- **Clarity Over Complexity:** Mylo minimizes options to reduce user overwhelm.

---

## MVP Mission

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of Mylo must accomplish:

- Allow Contributors to create multi-page documents.
- Allow Template Editors to create and publish Templates.
- Apply Templates automatically to document previews and exports.
- Provide a simple, focused Editor + Preview panel experience.
- Support local save/load functionality with `.mylo` files.
- Enforce clean role-based permissions for Contributor, Template Editor, Admin, and Guest.

**MVP success is defined as:**
> "A Contributor can write and preview a document that matches the visual rules defined by a Template Editor â€” without touching any design controls."

---

## Future Vision (Light)

Beyond MVP, Mylo aims to become a powerful yet intuitive system supporting:

- **Flexible Style Ranges:** Allow Contributors limited flexibility (e.g., font size 10â€“14pt) controlled by Templates.
- **Template Marketplace:** A way to browse, buy, or share Templates across teams and companies.
- **Advanced Typography Control:** Features like widow control, optical kerning, smart spacing adjustments.
- **AI-Assisted Writing and Layout (Future)** Explore tools to help Contributors improve clarity and fit their content within template constraints â€” such as rewrite suggestions, summaries, or layout-aware nudges.
- **Full Native Desktop Versions:** Identical web and desktop app experiences for all users.

Mylo will always prioritize clarity, user empowerment, and brand integrity at its core.
