# Mylo Product Vision — v2.0

June 2025

---

# Overview

Mylo is a structured writing environment designed for clarity, consistency, and collaboration. Writers get freedom while templates enforce design standards in a seamless dual-panel experience. Our goal is to combine brand-safe formatting with creative flexibility—without requiring users to understand design systems.

---

# The Problem

Most writing tools (Word, Google Docs, Notion) provide formatting power but no visual quality control. Organizations end up with:

- Poorly formatted documents
- Inconsistent branding
- Templates that are ignored or too complex
- Writers wasting time fixing formatting

---

# The Solution

Mylo separates writing from layout. Writers type freely, while the template controls appearance in a live Preview panel. Final formatting is enforced automatically—no manual cleanup needed.

---

# Our Philosophy

- **Writers write. Designers design.** No role confusion.
- **Templates aren’t optional** — they’re applied at the system level.
- **Live preview > guessing** — see what your document will look like.
- **Structure beats style** — formatting rules are embedded in the template, not the document.

---

# MVP Mission

For the first release, Mylo must support:

- One editable document at a time per user
- Split-panel writing + preview experience
- Real-time autosave and undo/redo
- Templates that define typography, layout, and formatting logic
- Local file saving using the `.mylo` format
- A basic dashboard to access recent documents and templates

This version prioritizes solo use, design integrity, and platform stability.
