# Mylo Starter Kit — Specification Organization Standard

All official Mylo Starter Kit specifications must follow the structure defined below. This ensures consistency, clarity, and efficient onboarding for anyone contributing to Mylo documentation or feature development.

---

# Overview

Each specification must begin with a clear overview that explains the purpose and scope of the document at a high level.

---

# MVP Scope

This section defines what functionality, features, or behaviors are included for the initial MVP release of the feature. Items outside the MVP must be excluded or listed separately in Future Enhancements.

---

# \[Main Behavior Sections]

One or more detailed sections describing how the system behaves, including:

* Save Behavior Rules
* UI Behavior
* Stack Behavior
* Data Models
* Field Definitions

This section may be subdivided with additional second-level headings (`##`) as needed.

---

# \[Additional Technical Sections] (Optional)

If the feature has diagrams, complex flows, API schemas, or other technical artifacts, they should be included after the main behavior sections. These are optional depending on feature complexity.

---

# Error Handling

A mandatory section defining how the system responds to failures, including:

* Validation errors
* Save/export errors
* Load/render failures
* Offline behaviors

---

# Known Gaps / Outstanding Questions

This section captures unresolved decisions or implementation blockers that have been flagged but not yet finalized. Each item should map to a checklist task if possible.

* Do we need font fallback strategy for export? (Effort: Medium, Status: To do)
* Should we show template diffs on template switch? (Effort: High, Mockup: Y)

Use this to track uncertainty, not to document behavior.

---

# Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

Ideas, features, or improvements that are explicitly out of scope for MVP. These may include:

* Variable font support
* Real-time collaboration
* Enterprise-wide font libraries

---

# Technical Dependencies (Optional)

Used to list libraries, integrations, or platform-specific requirements such as:

* Tiptap extensions
* Supabase storage bucket names
* FontFace API usage
* Google Fonts integration

---

# API / Data Schema Notes (If Applicable)

Use this section when the feature defines or relies on specific backend data models or save formats.

* Template object structure
* Font metadata JSON
* Document versioning schema

---

# Version

Each specification must include a version number and timestamp.

Example:
Mylo Font Handling Specification v2.0 — June 2025
