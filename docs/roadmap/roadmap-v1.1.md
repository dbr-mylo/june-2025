# MVP Roles (Clarified)

| **Contributor** | Write content, select template, see Preview |
| **Template Editor** | All Contributor permissions + manage templates |
| **Admin** | Full control over teams, users, and assignments |

# Future Planning Principles

- Templates come before layout freedom
- All formatting rules must be traceable
- Contributors should never be forced to manage design
- Collaboration should not dilute brand control
- Templates are always visible â€” but never directly editable by Contributors
