# Mylo Role-Based Routing & Permissions (Template Editor Role) Specification

This specification defines role-based access and routing logic for the **Template Editor** role, ensuring Template Editors have access to template management and creation tools while being restricted from content editing features.

---

# Overview

Template Editors should only have access to **template-related pages** and tools, and should be restricted from accessing **writing-related pages** or features intended for **Contributors**. This helps ensure clear and streamlined workflows for both roles.

---

# MVP Scope

- **React Router** will be used to handle **role-based page access**.
- Template Editors will have access to the following pages: `/templates`, `/template-creation`.
- Contributors will have access to writing-related pages: `/write`, `/documents`.
- Unauthorized attempts to access restricted pages will redirect Template Editors to `/templates` with an appropriate alert.

---

# Functional Requirements

**Template Editor**
- As a Template Editor, I can only access template-related pages such as `/templates`, `/template-creation` as outlined in **[Template Editor User Stories](file-template-editor-user-stories.md)**.
- As a Template Editor, I should be **redirected** if I try to access writing-related features (e.g., `/write`), which are described in the **[Contributor User Stories](file-contributor-user-stories.md)**.
- As a Template Editor, I should receive an alert or message explaining that I do not have permission to access a restricted page, as per the **[Template Editor User Stories](file-template-editor-user-stories.md)**.

**Developer**
- As a Developer, I will implement routing logic using **React Router** to conditionally render pages based on the user role.
- As a Developer, I will use **`<Navigate>`** for redirecting unauthorized users.
- As a Developer, I will use **localStorage** to store the user role and ensure persistence across sessions.

# Error Handling

| Failure                        | System Response | User-facing Message |
|:---                            |:---             |:---                 |
| Template Editor tries to access private page | Redirect to `/templates` | "You do not have access to this page." |
| No role found in localStorage  | Default role to Template Editor, redirect to `/templates` | "Role not found. Defaulting to Template Editor." |

---

# Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Fine-grained permission controls for admins to override role-based access restrictions.
- Ability to customize the access levels for different roles (e.g., partial access for Template Editor).
- Enhanced role management for dynamic role-based UI updates.
