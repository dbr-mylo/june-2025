## üß† Document Style Principles

- Every spec follows the `starter-kit-spec-organization-standard-V2.md` structure.
- All filenames include a semantic version number (e.g., `-v1.2.md`).
- When patched, older files may be moved to `archive/` or versioned upward.
- Each spec is self-contained: no external tool links are required to understand behavior.
