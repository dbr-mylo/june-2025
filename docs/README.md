# Mylo Starter Kit

Welcome to the **Mylo Starter Kit**! 🎉

This kit contains everything needed to understand, design, build, and expand the Mylo application, whether you are a developer, template editor, product manager, or collaborator.

Mylo is a new kind of document system that separates **content creation** from **design enforcement**, empowering companies to maintain consistent branding without limiting writing freedom.

# 🔀 Key Concepts

- **MVP vs Future:** Each spec clearly separates what's required for the MVP launch vs what is planned for future enhancements.
- **Structured Simplicity:** Documents are clean, actionable, and built for fast onboarding.
- **Role-Centric:** Features and permissions are always tied back to specific Mylo user roles.
