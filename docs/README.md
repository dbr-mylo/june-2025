# Mylo Starter Kit

Welcome to the **Mylo Starter Kit**! 🎉

This kit contains everything needed to understand, design, build, and expand the Mylo application, whether you are a developer, template editor, product manager, or collaborator.

Mylo is a new kind of document system that separates **content creation** from **design enforcement**, empowering companies to maintain consistent branding without limiting writing freedom.

# 🔀 Key Concepts

- **MVP vs Future:** Each spec clearly separates what's required for MVP launch vs what is scoped for future releases.
- **Structured Simplicity:** Documents are short, direct, and designed for fast onboarding and iterative collaboration.
- **Role-Centric Design:** All features and permissions are grounded in Mylo's clearly defined user roles.

# 🔍 How to Navigate This Kit

1. **Start with `product-vision/`** to understand the high-level strategy.
2. **Review `user-roles-permissions/`** to see how capabilities are distributed by role.
3. **Explore `core-features/`** for technical and UX requirements.
4. **Use `user-stories/`** to understand what users should be able to do.
5. **Walk through `user-flows/`** for real-world interaction paths.
6. **Study `data-models/`** to connect UI features to backend logic.
7. **Check `roadmap/`** for delivery sequence and what's in scope.
8. **Read remaining folders (`font-handling/`, `autosave/`, etc.)** for specialized systems.

# 💡 Document Style Principles

- Use clear, plain language — avoid jargon unless defined in the glossary.
- Always separate MVP from future functionality.
- Keep documents visually scannable (short paragraphs, bullets, whitespace).
- Define acceptance criteria where relevant to aid developer implementation.
