# Mylo Breadcrumbs Behavior Specification — v1.0

June 2025

---

# Overview

This document defines the breadcrumb behavior across all major views in Mylo. Breadcrumbs are intended to support contextual navigation within folder or team hierarchies. They are not used as a universal history tracker or UI element within document editing.

---

# MVP Scope

- Breadcrumbs appear when navigating folders within:
  - Documents
  - Templates
  - Teams (Admin)
- Format examples:
  - `Documents ▸ Marketing`
  - `Templates ▸ Proposals`
  - `Teams ▸ Design Team`
- Breadcrumbs are non-interfering UI elements used solely for folder-based navigation.
- Breadcrumbs are clickable and allow navigation to parent folders.

# Main Behavior Sections

## Save Behavior Rules

*Not applicable. Breadcrumb state is view-only and transient.*

## UI Behavior

| Context | Breadcrumb Appears? | Example |
|--------|----------------------|---------|
| Folder View (Docs/Templates/Teams) | ✅ | `Documents ▸ Folder Name` |
| Default View (Recent Files, All Templates) | ❌ | N/A |
| Inside Editor + Preview Panel | ❌ | N/A |
| Global Admin Panels (User Management, Trash, Template Publishing) | ❌ | N/A |

- Breadcrumb links are active (not just display).
- Clicking breadcrumb item jumps to that context's parent view.
- Clicking breadcrumb does not modify browser history stack.

## Stack Behavior

- Breadcrumb state is derived from route and context — not persisted.
- No API calls are required to display breadcrumb text.
- No custom router logic for breadcrumb clicks.

## Data Models

*No data model is associated with this feature.*

## Field Definitions

*No fields defined — breadcrumb is computed from navigation context.*

# Additional Technical Sections (Optional)

### Edge Case Consideration: Templates Inside Teams

In future nested views (e.g., `Teams ▸ Design Team ▸ Templates ▸ Proposal Docs`), the breadcrumb component may support deeper nesting. This is out of scope for MVP.

---

# Error Handling

| Condition | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Folder not found | Display fallback: `Documents` with no nested name |
| Invalid folder route | Redirect to root section view with default state |
| Breadcrumb click fails | Log error and fallback to route history |

---

# Known Gaps / Outstanding Questions

- Will breadcrumb support be extended to shared folders or projects in future? (Effort: Medium, Status: TBD)
- Should breadcrumbs reflect filter/sort state? (Effort: Low, Status: Rejected)
- Is support for mobile-responsiveness needed? (Effort: Medium, Status: Not addressed)

---

# Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Breadcrumb nesting for team-scoped views
- Multi-level breadcrumbs inside template libraries
- Mobile breadcrumb dropdowns for space efficiency

---

# Technical Dependencies (Optional)

- Route context extractor
- Breadcrumb component (non-interfering)
- Optional i18n string formatter

---

# API / Data Schema Notes (If Applicable)

*None — breadcrumb context is UI-driven only.*
