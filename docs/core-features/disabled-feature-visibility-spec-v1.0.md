# Disabled Feature Visibility Specification — v1.0

June 2025

---

# Overview

This document defines how disabled, unavailable, or post-MVP features are handled in the Mylo UI. The intent is to minimize user confusion, maintain a clean interface, and signal roadmap intent only where necessary.

---

# MVP Scope

## Visibility Rules

- **Hidden by Default**:  
  - Disabled or post-MVP features should not be shown in the UI.
  - Exceptions apply only to key roadmap indicators.

- **Coming Soon Label** (optional):
  - Used for high-impact, visible roadmap items.
  - Accompanied by a tooltip or info icon.
  - Must not allow interaction (clicks, hovers triggering state changes).

---

# Main Behavior Sections

## Save Behavior Rules

*Not applicable — no state is saved for hidden or disabled UI elements.*

## UI Behavior

### Contributor Role

- Disabled tools are not displayed in the formatting toolbar or Insert menu.
- If placeholder text is necessary, it must:
  - Be non-interactive.
  - Use muted or gray styling.
  - Not produce any click or hover behavior.

### Template Editor Role

- Inactive or post-MVP style logic is excluded entirely from the interface.
- Tools related to template intelligence or automation should not appear until implemented.

### Admin Role

- UI visibility is governed by backend feature flags.
- Admins may preview unreleased features only if explicitly enabled.

## Mockup Guidance

- Disabled items:
  - Should use a consistent visual style (gray text, "Coming Soon" badge).
  - Tooltip may say: *“Coming in v2.0”*
- Avoid disruptive layout changes when toggling visibility.

---

# Stack Behavior

- Feature flags should be managed at the session or global config level.
- Features are toggled by backend logic or environment settings.

## Example Logic

```js
if (features.AI_CLASSIFICATION) {
  renderAiTools();
}
```

- Never allow rendering of disabled buttons unless fully non-interactive.

# Data Models

*Not applicable — feature state is UI-only and ephemeral.*

## Field Definitions

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| features | Object | Feature flag map keyed by name |
| enabled | Boolean | True/False flag per feature |

---

# Additional Technical Sections (Optional)

*Central feature flag registry planned post-MVP.*

---

# Error Handling

| Condition | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Click on a hidden feature | Impossible — feature not rendered |
| Click on disabled feature | Show tooltip only, no error |
| Feature toggle fails | Log warning to console; do not display fallback |

---

# Known Gaps / Outstanding Questions

- Should Admins have a toggleable “Preview Mode”? (Effort: Medium, Status: Under Discussion)
- Should beta features be toggleable per user session? (Effort: Medium, Status: Future Consideration)

---

# Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Feature flag dashboard for Admins
- Per-role toggle testing
- In-app announcements linked to feature unlocks

---

# Technical Dependencies (Optional)

- Session config or environment config system
- Role-aware rendering logic in all UI layers

---

# API / Data Schema Notes (If Applicable)

*Feature flags may eventually be controlled via a centralized API endpoint.*
