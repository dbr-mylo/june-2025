# Mylo Guest Demo Mode Specification

---

# Overview

Provide an instant, frictionless way for prospective users to explore Mylo without creating an account or selecting a role. This is not a full user role. It’s a temporary, local-only experience.

---

# MVP Scope

* Guest demo is triggered via a single "Try Demo" button.
* No authentication, session token, or role selection required.
* All data is ephemeral and stored locally (in-memory or via `localStorage`).
* Focus is on showing core UI and basic interactions, not real feature depth or persistence.

---

# Demo Mode Behavior

## Entry Point

* Button: **Try Demo**
* Action: Immediately enters demo mode and loads a default Contributor-like experience.

## UI & Labeling

* A visible banner displays: `Demo Mode`
* Tooltip or modal explains limitations (e.g., no saving/exporting)

## Data Handling

* Load pre-seeded mock data (documents, templates)
* No API calls or backend interaction
* All actions are local only

## Feature Access

| Feature         | Behavior                               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Save Document   | Disabled (tooltip: "Sign up to save")  |
| Export PDF      | Disabled or mocked                     |
| Create Template | Disabled or mocked                     |
| User Management | Hidden                                 |
| AI Features     | Disabled or hardcoded mocks (optional) |

## Session Rules

* Use `localStorage.demoMode = true` to toggle state
* Data is reset on page refresh or tab close
* No 2-hour expiration, session tokens, or idle timers

---

# Error Handling

* Attempting to use disabled actions (e.g., Save, Export) should show tooltips or non-blocking alerts.
* Any internal failures in mock data loading should fall back to an empty state and display a toast or banner.
* Network errors should not occur — demo mode must be completely offline/local.

---

# Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

* Allow Guest to convert session to full signup
* Add lightweight analytics (e.g., time spent, features clicked)
